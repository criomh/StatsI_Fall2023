y <- c(105, 69, 86, 100, 82, 111, 104, 110, 87, 108, 87, 90, 94, 113, 112, 98, 80, 97, 95, 111, 114, 89, 95, 126, 98)

# Q1: Find 90% confidence interval for the average student IQ in the school

# This question is asking to use statistics from a sample (25 random students) to estimate population parameters (the whole school) - in this case, a confidence interval, which is a range of numbers within which the parameter is believed to fall 90\% of the time with repeated sampling. This requires us to assume a normal sampling distribution.

# First I find the point estimate - or sample mean - which is the sum of all the observation values divided by the total number of observations. I also find the sample's n-size. 
n_y <- length(y)
mean(y) == sum(y)/n_y # is TRUE
mean_y <- mean(y)

# Now I find the sample standard deviation - which is a measure of the spread/dispersion within the sample. This is calculated by first calculating the variance (the sum of the squared distances of each observation from the sample mean (ensuring observations above and below the mean don't cancel out) divided by the total number of observations less one ie n-1). The SD is the square root of the variance, returning the value from squared to original (and more easily comparable) units. I further divide this by the square root of total observations to find the standard error for the sampling distribution ie an estimator for the deviation of sample means with repeated sampling).

sqrt(var(y)) == sd(y) # is TRUE
sd_y <- sd(y)
se_y <- sd_y/sqrt(n_y)

# I now define the corresponding p-value for 90\% confidence. Will the calculated values, I can manually approximate the 90\% confidence intervals by multiplying the corresponding Z-score (aka critical value) to the alpha value for 90\% confidence (ie 0.1 including both tails of the distribution, or 0.05 each tail) with the standard error, and then adding/subtracting this figure from the sample mean. In other words, I am adding/subtracting the 'margin for error' to calculate the confidence intervals.

p = (1-0.9)
z_score <- qnorm(p/2, lower.tail = FALSE) # finds corresponding Z-score to the p-value 0.05.
lower_90 <- mean_y - z_score*se_y
upper_90 <- mean_y + z_score*se_y

# Alternatively, I can use the qnorm() function to calculate the lower and upper values. This can be more precise if some figures such as z-score or standard deviation/error have been rounded.

lower_90 == qnorm(p/2, mean = mean_y, sd = se_y) # TRUE confirms the values are the same 
upper_90 == qnorm(1-(p/2), mean = mean_y, sd = se_y) # TRUE confirms the values are the same

# These bounds indicate that, with 90\% confidence with repeated sampling, the population mean (ie the school average IQ) is within the values 94.13 and 102.75 (rounded to two decimal places). 

# Q2:  Next, the school counselor was curious whether the average student IQ in
# her school is higher than the average IQ score (100) among all the schools in
# the country. Using the same sample, conduct the appropriate hypothesis test
# with Î± = 0.05.

# This question requires a significance test for a mean using the t.test() function. I do not specify alpha as the default is 0.05. I specity the alternarive "greater" to ensure the test is directional and in the correct direction.

# H0: The average IQ score among all schools (mean\_all) is NOT less than or equal to the average IQ score of our sample (mean\_y).

# HA: The average IQ score among all schools (mean\_all) IS INDEED less than or equal to the sample (mean\_y).

mean_all <- 100
t_test_result <- t.test(x = y, mu = mean_all, alternative = "greater")

# I install and load the "stargazer" package to enable outputting the t-test results to LaTeX.
install.packages("stargazer")
library(stargazer)

# This creates the function necessary for outputting correctly.
output_stargazer <- function(outputFile, ...) {
  output <- capture.output(stargazer(...))
  cat(paste(output, collapse = "\n"), "\n", file=outputFile, append=TRUE)
}

# I use the funciton to output the results into a readable file for LaTeX.
output_stargazer("t_test_result.tex", t_test_result)

# The result indicates that p > 0.05, failing to reject the null hypothesis. In full, this means I cannot reject the null hypothesis that the counsellor's school's average IQ score is higher than the average IQ score for all schools.

### P1: Please plot the relationship between Y and Region. On average, which region has the highest per capita expenditure on housing assistance?

# I plot the variables accordingly. Most plots appear to indicate some positive correlation between the two variables. I highlight the correlations between Y and X1, as well as X1 and X2 as being relatively clear. Meanwhile, the (positive) relationship between Y and X3 appears relatively weak or non-existent. I use the png() function to print the plots.
